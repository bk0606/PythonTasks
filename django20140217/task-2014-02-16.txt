1. Add models to Django App of Blog.

Post
fields:
	text:
	title:
	date and time of post:
	
Comment
fields
	post:
	text:
	date and time of post:
	
2. Let these models be in admin section of site. Using this link:

http://djbook.ru/rel1.6/intro/tutorial02.html #yes, it's in russian :)

change the style of the page. 
I want the list of all objects be not just like the list but like the nice table
(e.g., http://djbook.ru/rel1.6/_images/admin13t.png)

i don't need any additional colums that are not mentioned in models.py (like 'was published recently' in example above). Just model's fields.
